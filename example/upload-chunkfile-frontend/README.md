## Features

- **Chunked Uploads:** Split large files into smaller chunks for reliable uploads.
- **Customizable Chunk Size:** Set your preferred chunk size based on network conditions.
- **Abortable Uploads:** Cancel ongoing uploads using AbortController.
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress updates for a better user experience.
- **Flexible HTTP Methods:** Support for POST, PUT, or any HTTP method.
- **Multi-File and Single-File Upload Modes:** Adaptable to different use cases.

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Large File Uploads:** Handles large files without overwhelming network resources.
2. **Resumable Uploads:** Easily implement resumable uploads (with additional backend support).
3. **Progress Feedback:** Keeps users informed about upload progress.
4. **Network Efficiency:** Avoids uploading the entire file again if an error occurs mid-transfer.

## Installation

Upload-chunkfile already published on npm.

```bash
npm install upload-chunkfile
# or
yarn add upload-chunkfile
# or
pnpm add upload-chunkfile
# or
bun add upload-chunkfile
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

You can integrate this library by importing it into your project:

```javascript
import UploadChunkFile from "upload-chunkfile";
```

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use UploadChunkFile to upload a file:

```javascript
const uploader = new UploadChunkFile({
  uploadType: "multiple", // Use 'single' for single-chunk uploads. DEFAULT: 'multiple'
  method: "POST", // DEFAULT: 'POST'
  chunkSize: 2 * 1024 * 1024, // 2MB chunk size. DEFAULT: 5MB
});

const file = document.querySelector("#fileInput").files[0]; // Select a file input element

uploader
  .uploadFile({
    file,
    uploadUrl: "https://your-server.com/upload",
    onProgressChange: (progress) => {
      console.log(`Upload Progress: ${progress.toFixed(2)}%`);
    },
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log("Upload completed successfully:", response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Upload failed:", error);
  });
```

### Abort Upload

```javascript
const abortController = new AbortController();
const uploader = new UploadChunkFile(
  {
    /* Options */
  },
  abortController.signal
);

setTimeout(() => {
  abortController.abort();
  console.log("Upload aborted");
}, 5000); // Abort after 5 seconds
```

### React Usage

```javascript
const [file, setFile] = (useState < File) | (null > null);
const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);

const handleUpload = useCallback(async () => {
  const uploadChunkFile = new UploadChunkFile({
    maxParallel: 1,
    retryDelay: 100,
    payloadOptions: {
      chunkName: "file",
    },
  });

  if (file) {
    try {
      const res = await uploadChunkFile.uploadFile({
        file,
        uploadUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/upload",
        onProgressChange: (progress) => {
          setProgress(progress);
        },
      });
      console.log(res);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  }
}, [file]);
```

## Configuration Options

`UploadChunkFile` take two parameters, first one is `options` object and second one is `AbortSignal`

1. `options` parameter value.

| Option        | Type     | Default           | Description                                                       |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `method`      | `string` | `'POST'`          | HTTP method used for the upload. `'POST'` `'PUT'` `'PATCH'`       |
| `uploadType`  | `string` | `'multiple'`      | `'single'` for single upload or `'multiple'` for chunked uploads. |
| `chunkSize`   | `number` | `5 * 1024 * 1024` | Size of the each chunk                                            |
| `maxRetries`  | `number` | `2`               | How many time the request retry if failed                         |
| `retryDelay`  | `number` | `1000`            | Delay of each request retry                                       |
| `maxParallel` | `number` | `1`               | How many request will send as parallelly                          |

2. `options` can take `payloadOptions` value that can be used to modify the payload options.

| Option         | Type     | Default        | Description                                    |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `chunkName`    | `string` | `chunk`        | This is each chunk name in the payload         |
| `fileName`     | `string` | `fileName`     | This is each file name in the payload          |
| `currentChunk` | `string` | `currentChunk` | This is each current chunk name in the payload |
| `totalChunk`   | `string` | `totalChunk`   | This is total chunk name in the payload        |

3. `uploadChunkFile.uploadFile` parameter value.

| Option             | Type                         | Default | Description                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `file`             | `File`                       | `null`  | This is the file                       |
| `uploadUrl`        | `string`                     | `null`  | This is the upload url                 |
| `onProgressChange` | `(progress: number) => void` | `null`  | This is the progress callback function |

## How It Works

1. **File Splitting:** The file is divided into chunks based on the specified chunkSize.
2. **Sequential Uploads:** Each chunk is uploaded sequentially to the server.
3. **Error Handling:** If an error occurs during a chunk upload, the process can be retried (requires additional implementation).
4. **Progress Reporting:** The progress is calculated and reported using the onProgressChange callback.

## Faq

1. How do I handle resumable uploads?
   You can implement resumable uploads by adding metadata to each chunk (e.g., chunk index) and handling them on the server side.

2. What happens if a chunk fails to upload?
   The uploadFile method rejects the promise if a chunk fails to upload. You can implement retry logic in your application.

3. Can I use this with any backend?
   Yes! The package is backend-agnostic. As long as your backend supports receiving file chunks, it will work seamlessly.
